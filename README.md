# Youtube-data-science-project
Data science project with the aim of answering certain questions about the success factors of YouTube channels

Questions to be answered:

Do new channels have the potential to be successful on YouTube or just older channels that are already established on the platform?
Does the creator's nationality and language used influence the channel's popularity?
Are there any correlations between the number of subscribers and video views for YouTubers?
